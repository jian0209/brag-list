  - 10 of which have been publicly disclosed.
  - 4 withheld for security reasons.
- 5Ghoul attacks range from temporary service disruptions to network downgrades, which may be more severe from a security standpoint.
- The attacker does not need to be aware of any secret information of the target UE e.g., UE's SIM card details, to complete the NAS network registration
