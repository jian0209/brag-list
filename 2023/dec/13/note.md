  - Product Discovery is the ongoing, non-linear, but connected practice to reduce uncertainty around the problem or solution space.

  - Product Discovery prioritizes activities through a sense of urgency around the ​most consequential areas of uncertainty​ of the moment.
- Who Done It
  - Research Projects are done outside the responsible product team.
  - Product Discovery is done by the responsible product team

# Avoid The Next Product Failure: Rethinking Your Product Strategy

[Reference from TLDR](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/05/27/avoid-the-next-product-failure-rethinking-your-product-strategy/?utm_source=tldrproduct&sh=1606a5e84ea7)

- Might be
  - A failure to anticipate rapidly changing market requirements.
  - Inadequate product innovation
  - A reliance on incremental sales strategies and distribution moves taking high-risk, high-reward.
  - Companies lose focus on their new product development, and starve projects for resources and miss the mark in the marketplace.
- For Example:
  - Netflix has a key-performance-indicator and margin-driven strategy that focuses on maximizing adoption and retention in a subscription-based model.
  - Age-old Coca-Cola has a strategy that appears to be all about the voice of the customer.
- More established companies might invest 25% of their product development in innovative products, while growth technology companies might invest 60% in riskier, but more rewarding, efforts.
- 1. Start with your vision
  - Brand vision needs to be enduring and inspiring.
  - It should speak, at the highest level, to the benefits your brand brings to customers.
  - It should also describe what success looks like and define clearly the areas the strategy will not pursue.
- 2. Articulate your brand's top three advantages
  - Must be unique and more than 3.
  - Make sure you know what your brand offers that others don't and that you remain true to your brand position.
- 3. Identify big problems to solve
  - Focus on customers' pain points.
- 4. Define your investment in new products
  - Should allocate between 2% and 20% of revenue to truly innovative, new-to-the-world products. 
- 5. Guide your investments with your road map
