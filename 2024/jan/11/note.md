## Tekton

- Tekton, an open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems.
- Flexibility and power to handle various deployment environments and cloud providers as well as on-premise.
- Its ability to abstract the underlying implementation allows teams to tailor their build, test, and deploy workflows to their specific needs.

- Tekton Pipelines are Cloud Native:
  - Run on Kubernetes
  - Have Kubernetes clusters as a first-class type
  - Use containers as their building blocks
- Tekton Pipeines are Decoupled:
  - One Pipeline can be used to deploy to any k8s cluster
  - The Tasks which make up a Pipeline can easily be run in isolation
  - Resources such as git repos can easily be swapped between runs
  
## Middleware.io

- [Middleware.io](https://middleware.io/)
- An advanced AI-powered cloud observability platform designed.
- To streamline and enhance the monitoring and management of cloud infrastructure.
- Proactively detect and diagnose issues within infrastructure, applications, databases, logs, containers, and more.
