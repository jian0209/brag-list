# Why pomodoro doesn't work? Try this alternative

- What is Pomodoro
  - Developed by Francesco Cirillo.
  - Is a time management technique.
  - Uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by 5-minute short breaks.
- Why Pomodoro might not work for developers
  - Interruption of Flow State
    - When you're deeply engrossed in a complex problem, stopping because a timer goes off can break your train of thought.
  - Variable Task Length
    - Some tasks might require prolonged uninterrupted focus, while others are shorter and more straightforward.
  - Context Switching
    - This is counterproductive for tasks that require sustained concentration and a deep understanding of the problem at hand.
- The better alternative (Flowmodoro)
  - Created by Zoe Read-Bivens
  - Flowmodoro counts up instead of counting down.
  - It's a timer that can allow you focus until you naturally feel the need for break.
  - The timer formular is about divide 5 by your focus time, and set a countdown timer for your break.
  - This method respect your flow state and adapts to the variable nature of coding tasks.
- How to implement Flowmodoro
  - Pick One Task
    - Begin by selecting a single task to focus. (This ensures that your attention isn't divided across multiple tasks.)
  - Start the work
    - Start the stopwatch when your task is chosen. (This marks the beginning of your focus time.)
  - Stop the work
    - Keep working until you naturally feel the need for a break. (This could be when you feel your concentration waning or you've reached a logical stopping point in your task)
    - Stop the stopwatch, and record the time you spent focusing.
  - Take a break
    - Calculate your break time as one-fifth of your focused work duration.
- Automate the process
  - The author of the artical has found a web app that automates the process of Flowmodoro.
