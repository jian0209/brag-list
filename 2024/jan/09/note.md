  - Detailing state-sponsored attacks targeting public and private entities in the Middle East and North Africa.
- The infrastructure of the targets was susceptible to supply chain and island-hopping attacks.
- The attack group used to collect politically motivated information such as personal information on minority groups and potential political dissents.
- Primarily leveraging DNS hijacking to redirect prospective targets attempting to query a specific domain to an actor-controlled server capable of harvesting their credentials.
- Using SnappyTCP, the threat actor sent commands to the system to create a copy of an email archive created with the tool tar, in the public web directory of the website that was accessible from the internet.
- It is highly likely that the threat actor exfiltrated the email archive by downloading the file directly from the web directory.
