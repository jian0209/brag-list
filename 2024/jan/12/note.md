- Phising-driven ransomware is the cyber threat that looms larger and more dangerous than all others.
- CISA and Cisco report that 90% of data breaches are the result of phishing attacks and monetary losses that exceed $10 billion in total.
- To fight phishing attacks head-on, they must upgrade the primary targets of phishing: credentials and legacy MFA.
- Next-generation MFA replaces traditional credentials, password-based authentication, and inconvenient and vulnerable legacy MFA solutions.
- Next-generation MFA devices like Token Ring stop the most sophisticated phishing attacks and are the best defense against the coming phishing Armageddon.
