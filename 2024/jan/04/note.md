- IT and security teams have found themselves contending with an ever-sprawling SaaS attack surface, much of which is often unknown or unmanaged.
- IT security leaders need practical and effective SaaS security solutions designed to discover and manage their expanding SaaS footprint.
- There are five key steps:
  - Close the visibility gap
    - Without an understanding of your entire SaaS footprint, you cannot say with confidence where your corporate IP is stored.
    - You cannot make assumptions about your customer data.
    - You certainly can't make strong assertions about your production data.
    - Nudge Security addresses this problem with real-time, continuous SaaS discovery that does not require agents, browser plug-ins, network proxies, or complicated API configurations.
  - Manage OAuth risks
    - "who (and what SaaS applications) have access to my corporate assets?"
    - Attackers are taking advantage of this complexity to move laterally across the SaaS supply chain to get to the crown jewels.
    - Nudge Security provides the context you need to simplify this process.
  - Monitor your SaaS attack surface
    - The complex and interconnected nature of the modern SaaS attack surface makes it possible for attackers to move through the software supply chain to find valuable assets.
    - the SaaS attack surface extends to every SaaS, IaaS and PaaS application, account, user credential, OAuth grant, API, and SaaS supplier used in your organizationâ€”managed or unmanaged.
    - Nudge Security includes a SaaS attack surface dashboard to show you all externally facing assets attackers could see, including SaaS apps, cloud infrastructure, dev tools, social media accounts, registered domains, and more.
  - Expand SSO coverage
    - Single sign-on (SSO) provides a centralized place to manage employees' access to enterprise SaaS applications, which makes it an integral part of any modern SaaS identity and access governance program.
    - Nudge Security shows you which apps are enrolled in SSO (and which are not) along with context on each app so you can appropriately prioritize your SSO onboarding efforts.
  - Extend MFA usage
    - MFA especially important in today's digital landscape where identity-based attacks are increasingly common.
    - Can see which user accounts do have MFA enabled in Nudge Security.
